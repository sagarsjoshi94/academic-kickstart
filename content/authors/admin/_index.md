I am a roboticist working in the motion planning team at [Aurora Innovation](https://aurora.tech/).
I finished my PhD in robotics at Georgia Tech's Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Machines [(IRIM)](http://www.robotics.gatech.edu/) in May 2022.
I was advised by [Prof.Panagiotis Tsiotras](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/tsiotras.html) and was fortunate to collaborat with [Prof.Seth Hutchinson](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~seth/).
My PhD thesis titled, "Informed Exploration Algorithms for Robot Motion Planning and Learning" [(pdf)](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/66535), proposes a family of intelligent exploration algorithms for efficient motion planning and learning.
My research area lies at the exciting intersection of A.I and heuristics, machine learning and optimal-control theory. 
I graduated from [IIT-Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in 2017 with a Bachelor's and Master's in Engineering Design, where I worked on planning and control of autonomous ground vehicles with [Prof.Shankar Ram C S](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~shankarram/).
