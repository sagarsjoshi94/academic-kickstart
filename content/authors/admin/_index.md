I am a Robotics PhD student advised by [Prof.Panagiotis Tsiotras](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/tsiotras.html) in the Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Machines [(IRIM)](http://www.robotics.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, USA. Currently, I am working on [intelligent exploration](http://dcsl.gatech.edu/research/random.html) techniques for sampling-based motion planning. My research area lies at the exciting intersection of A.I and heuristics, Machine learning and optimal-control theory. I graduated from [IIT-Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in 2017 with a Bachelor's and Master's in Engineering Design, where I worked on planning and control of autonomous ground vehicles with [Prof.Shankar Ram C S](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~shankarram/).
