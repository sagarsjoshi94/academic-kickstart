abstract: "Anytime sampling-based methods are an attractive technique for solving kino-dynamic motion plan-ning problems.  These algorithms scale well to higher dimensions and can efficiently handle stateand control constraints.  However, an intelligent exploration strategy is required to accelerate theirconvergence and avoid redundant computations.  This work defines a “Time Informed Set”, usingideas from reachability analysis, that focuses the search for time-optimal kino-dynamic planning af-ter an initial solution is found. Such a Time Informed Set includes all trajectories that can potentiallyimprove the current best solution.  Exploration outside this set is hence redundant.  Benchmarkingexperiments show that an exploration strategy based on the TIS can accelerate the convergence ofsampling-based kino-dynamic motion planners."
