abstract: "Sampling-based algorithms solve the path planning problem by generating random samples in the search-space and incrementally growing a connectivity graph or a tree. Conventionally, the sampling strategy used in these algorithms is biased towards exploration to acquire information about the search-space. In contrast, this work proposes an optimization-based procedure that generates new samples to improve the cost-to-come value of vertices in a neighborhood. The application of proposed algorithm adds an exploitative-bias to sampling and results in a faster convergence 1 to the optimal solution compared to other state-of-the-art sampling techniques. This is demonstrated using benchmarking experiments performed for a variety of higher dimensional robotic planning tasks."
